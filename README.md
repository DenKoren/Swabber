Swabber
=======================

Swabber is an extensible file manager which allows you to move, create, delete files by rules.

=======================

Swabber can list directory (directories) contents and apply filters to this list (you can define custom filters for your own needs). After filtration an actions are applied on the items in filtered list.

Filters can be custom too.

So, for example, you can get all files in the specified directory, sort files by some criteria, drop from list first N files, drop from list some items, pointed by given symlinks and remove all items, kept in list.
